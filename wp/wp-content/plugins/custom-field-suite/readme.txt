Custom Field Suite (CFS) is a lightweight custom fields plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

Custom Field Suite (CFS) lets you add custom fields to various edit screens. Each "field group" lives in its own meta box. Add as many field groups as you need!

= Features =
* [How to Use CFS](http://uproot.us/docs/how-to-use-cfs/)
* Many field types: [Text](http://uproot.us/docs/text/), [Textarea](http://uproot.us/docs/textarea/), [Visual Editor](http://uproot.us/docs/wysiwyg/), [Date](http://uproot.us/docs/date/), [Color](http://uproot.us/docs/color/), [Select](http://uproot.us/docs/select/), [File Upload](http://uproot.us/docs/file-upload/), [User](http://uproot.us/docs/user/), [Relationship](http://uproot.us/docs/relationship/), [Loop](http://uproot.us/docs/loop/) and you can also [create your own](http://uproot.us/docs/creating-custom-field-types/)!
* Loop fields are repeatable containers for other fields. For example, place a `File Upload` field into a `Loop` field to create a photo gallery!
* Each field group has a "Placement Rules" area, where you control which edit screens the field group should appear on
* CFS works well with [Gravity Forms](http://uproot.us/how-to-save-gravity-forms-data-into-custom-field-suite/), and can save Gravity Forms entries as post items.
* Drag-and-drop field management
* Field validation

**CFS is a fork of Advanced Custom Fields v2.** The main goals of CFS are stability, performance, and avoiding feature bloat.

= Why use Custom Field Suite? =
* CFS is super easy to use.
* CFS is stable. We thoroughly test our code before each release.
* Performance matters. CFS makes only a handful of database queries, and caching is used throughout.
* CFS is fast and uses few server resources.
* Custom fields can be searchable (using the default WordPress search) with the help of plugins like [Search Everything](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search-everything/).
